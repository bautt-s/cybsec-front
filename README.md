A simple front-end landing page project.

This was a completely front-end project made for a freelance client. It involves TypeScript, React, and a mix of Tailwind with traditional CSS. It can be viewed in a comfortable view in every device, while mantaining good design practices and a correct color scheme (following color theory).

## Installation

Running this front-end in a local machine is quite easy: just clone the repository into your local files, and then open the console in the same directory: command ``npm install`` to install all dependencies, and ``npm start`` to run the project on localhost.

The main dependencies are React 18.2, Tailwind 3.3.2, TypeScript 4.9.5, and React Icons 4.10.1 for all the SVGs displayed.
